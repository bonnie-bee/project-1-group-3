## Proposal

App Name: __FreshAir App__

Group 3 would like to create a map that searches for nearby parks and pulls the weather in that area.

The APIs that we would use are:
* Open Weather API
* Google Maps API

The user would search parks based on their preferences (for this we would create filters) and then the app would contact the Google Maps API to find a list of parks that fit those parameters. Once the user selects the park, then the page expands to only show that park. The weather API will be triggered when the park is selected and the weather for that park's location will be displayed on the new page. The app would also have a comment section on the same park page where reviews and comments of the park can be made!
